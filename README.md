# About The Project

I will be implementing a game of Tic Tac Toe with Ruby. I have created a class to be able to play this game.

# Usage

This game is easy to play

1. Create a game object with an argument of wether you start with X or O - e.g game = Game.new('X')

2. Use the instance method start to play the game - e.g game.start

That's it! Very easy, yeah?
